	<h3>Additional Information:</h3>
	<h5>Known Errors:</h5>
	<ul>
	<li>Currently, the back button does not function. This is because I tried to replicate how Gmail works in terms of its static site with dynamically loaded content. I chose to change the content of a container as opposed to using IFrames. I did this for one of two reasons. Reason one being that I would have to reload CSS and JS on each source change which creates overhead. Secondly, it created a lot of design issues. This back button issue can be fixed by implementing a little hashing system and appending to the end of the url. I didn't have time to implement this.</li>
	<li>The notices section on each clique page had to be scrapped. In its place lies a placeholder that shows how it would be laid out if it existed.</li>
	</ul>
