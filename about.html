		<hr/>
		<h5><p>Clique is an application that takes a new approach to online education and collaboration. By offering intuitive solutions for building online communities centered around the classroom, Clique is able bridge barriers between students and promote a more collaborative environment.</p></h5>

		<div align="center"><h3>Inspiration</h3></div>
		<hr/>
		<h5><p>Inspiration for Clique came from an article I read a while back that discussed the differences between online education versus a traditional institution. The author believed that online education wouldn't surpass traditional education until the classroom environment could be effectively replicated. Going off of this, the idea for Clique was born; platform that had equal focus on communication and collaboration as it did information dissemination.</p></h5>

		<hr/>
		<h5><p><b>One to One Communication:</b> Clique offers users the ability to have one to one communcations. The goal of this feature is to offer student a faster way to communicate with other members of their course. A specific example would be communicating with a professor. Generally professors take around 3 days to respond to an email often because it was "lost in their inbox". Clique provides professors with an area where they can see their students messages exclusively for a faster response time.</p></h5>
		<h5><p><b>Questioning:</b> Users can ask their clique questions. Questions entail a large body of text, regarding a topic of the class, and responses from fellow users. Questions are unique to each clique, meaning that one clique cannot see questions of another. Instructors as well as Assistants are allowed to see all questions from every clique. This way, they are allowed to support all students whilst tailoring support specifically to each clique.</p></h5>
		<h5><p><b>Real Time Chat</b>: Each clique has a near real time chat system. This is designed so that users can communicate with each other quickly and simply. I envision this system being able to offers users a way to share math equations, code, definitions, and other things in an intuitively laid out and formatted way. Additionally, students will be able to use this for scheduling study sesions.</p></h5>
		<h5><p><b>Google+ Hangouts</b>: Clique implements unique use of Google+ Hangouts. Cliques are able to use this to easily get in touch with each member of there clique via group video chat. This is designed as a supplement to online classes, to compensate for the lack of physical presence. By making cliques a little more personal, perhaps it will motivate students to collaborate and socialize, which could possibly boost grades. Each clique has a unique call. Each member of a clique can join their group call simply by clicking the G+ Hangout button. I chose Google+ Hangout over skype because Google+ offers support for 10 users without needed any premium subscription, while skype only supports two.</p></h5>

		<div align="center"><h3>Technical Features:</h3></div>
		<hr/>
		<h5><p><b>Responsive:</b> Clique has a highly responsive design. It formats flawlessly for any size device. I believe this is a vital feature given how mobile we are today. Sites such as Blackboard are horribly designed and can barely be used from a phone. If you want to use blackboard on the go, you are almost forced to download their bulky and slow app. Clique is designed so that users are free to visit it at all times without being tied to any single platform.</p></h5>
		<h5><p><b>Modern:</b> Clique is designed using modern programming methods and techniques. The site is presented with a static HTML5 site, but dynamically populated via javascript and jQuery.</p></h5>
		<h5><p><b>Blazing Fast</b>: Clique has a first view that averages 1.75s and a repeat view that averages a lowly .25 seconds. This means that there is a little to no delay in each page request, allowing for fluid application usage. Clique has an extremely small overhead and is highly cacheable, allowing for fast page requests as well as a minimal amount of them.</p></h5>
		<h5><p><b>Scalability</b>: Scalability was kept in mind when developing Clique. Clique's front end is completely seperate from the back, allowing for page requests and queries to be offset on entirely different servers. This means that hardware can be tailored to the application, instead of the other way around.</p></h5>
