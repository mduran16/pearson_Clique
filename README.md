Description
==============
Clique is my submission to the Pearson 2013 Student Coding Contest. The Pearson 2013 Student Coding Contest is a contest in which each team submits an idea proposal, and upon approval has to develop that idea into a function application. The requirements are that the application needs to extend the LearningStudio platform via its developer APIs.

Clique is the idea proposal I made for entering the contest. Essentially Clique is an application that connects students with one another based of certain factors and assists them in scheduling study sessions as well as offering mediums upon which to study together.

Inspiration
==============
Inspiration for the idea came from an article that Guy Kawasaki has posted a few months prior that discussed the difference between online and physical post secondary institutions. The article stated that while education is moving to an online environment, University of Phoenix being a prime example, online education won’t really replace traditional institutions until students can collaborate in a similar fashion. Coupled with this, prior experience has taught me that in online/hybrid classes the chances of you actually meeting your classmates are very small. From here I was able to derive niche for an application that connected students and allowed them to collaborate in all environments.

Features
==============
There are a few key features of Clique. The first being student connection. The goal is to connect students to each other whilst taking into account factors such as current standing, proximity, age, major, (etc). The application will suggest to users that they connect with around 4-5 other students. This will be their “clique” in which they can study, socialize, and collaborate with one another. Cliques will be diversified, incorporating students of different backgrounds and focus.

The second is to offer these cliques a medium to communicate on. The first method is a chat room that will be incorporated into the application. From here users can propose meetings based on time and medium upon which the clique can vote on how well that suggestion will work out. If it is decided that the meeting can occur, then it will be added to everyone’s respective calenders (Google Calenders).

Possible mediums include:

 - Skype: Users exchange Skype names. (Audio only unless a user in the clique has a premium subscription)
 - Google Hangout: Up to 4 members can video chat (free)
 
Instructors
==============
One of the features that Clique will offer is the ability for Instructors to examine which students are interacting with which as well as the composition of each group. Additionally, other factors such as the total time that the clique has spent interacting will be kept. This is so that instructors can examine how effective the groups are as well as possibly tailor instruction per clique.

TAs
==============
Teachers Assistants will have the ability to chime into any discussion upon request from a clique.
